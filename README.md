## Exercism Python

This repository contains all solutions for exercism python. I put it here mostly for myself, so I can access all solutions from Github, and probably to someone who might be wandering around.

[Exercism](http://exercism.io/) is a website with collections of exercises to practice/ramp up to a new language, with set of puzzles. It offers more than 30 languages, so python is just one of them.
